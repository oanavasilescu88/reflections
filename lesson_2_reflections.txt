What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The folder .git is added. Here git keeps the metadata and the history of commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediary location (imaginary folder) in which we add
files before committing them to git repository. This is useful so that we select
which files are committed to git. Maybe only a subset of the total files in the
working directory need to be committed to git.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Commands
git init: initializes or created a new repository  --> .git repository is created
git status: shows which files have changed since the last commit
git add: add file to staging area
--------------
Running git status on a repository which was just created (git init) will output:
On branch master
Initial commit
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	lesson_2_reflections.txt

If a file is added to the staging area (git add), after git status, we will see:
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   lesson_1_reflections.txt

------------
A commit = a snapshot of a git repository
Working area  --> Staging area --> Repository
